;; Static checks

; Concerns:
;   - (bind x) must occur within a scope.
;       - (nest a [(bind x) x]) shouldn't be legal as we have
;         no static guarantee about the length of a or whether its
;         associated non-terminal installs any scopes.
;       - {(nest a [(bind x) x)])} shouldn't be legal as it would imply binding
;         in a scope created by the nesting non-terminal, and the binding might
;         come after a reference created in the nesting non-terminal.
;   - Bindings should come before rec and references within a scope
;   - Exports may only occur at the top-level of a two-pass non-terminal,
;     and appear before rec and references
;   - Only one `recursive` group should appear in a scope, after bindings and before
;     references.
;
; Resulting contexts:
;   - Unscoped expression context; references only.
;   - Scoped expression context
;       - Bindings
;       - Then one recursive
;       - Then references
;   - Exporting context
;       - Exports
;       - Then re-exports
;       - Then references
; The body of a nest is an unscoped expression context, but ideally should have
; special error messages related to nest.
;
; As a grammar:
;
; one-pass-spec: unscoped-spec
; two-pass-spec: (seq (* (export _)) (* (re-export _)) refs+subexps)
; unscoped-spec: refs+subexps
; refs+subexps: (* (or (ref _) (nest _ unscoped-spec) (nest-one _ unscoped-spec) (scope scoped-spec)))
; scoped-spec:   (seq (* (or (bind-syntax _ _) (bind _))) (? (rec _)) refs+subexps)
;
; The implementation below separately implements refs+subexps for each context in which it occurs to
; provide specific error messages.
